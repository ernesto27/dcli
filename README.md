# Docker cli nice
This is a command line app that connect to the docker local daemon in order to execute some actions.

This is and alternative if you want to stay in the console using something more nicer that the default cli docker and do not want to use a web UI like portainer.

It uses the amazing lib bubbletea for create a nice UI in the terminal
